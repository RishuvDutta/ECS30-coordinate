# ECS30-coordinate
C program that constructs a coordinate plane based on coordinates entered by the user, determines if another set of coordinates are neighbors with the coordinates entered, and then swaps the coordinates entered. coordinate.h is the header file, coordinate.c is the file with all the function implementations, coordinate_driver.c tests the functions within coordinate.c.

To test the code, use coordinate_driver.c to test it. First compile coordinate.c and coordinate_driver.c to produce object files by using gcc with the -c flag. Then compile the object files and create an executable.
